# AMS 380 Projects
Collection of notebooks for projects I worked on in my Data Mining class

AMS380HW1
The project involved using Python to solve two problems:
1. The first problem required a regression function to obtain a point estimate of the mean service time of a machine.
2. The second problem required creating a confidence interval and conducting a t-test to determine a linear association between two variables.

AMS380HW2
The project used Python to build a multiple linear regression model to predict the median house value based on various features.
